## Documentation and Resources

As we go into details of any programming tool, you'll find that documentation is your best friend for learning and improving your tool skill set:

* [Git Homepage](https://git-scm.com)
* [Git Docs](https://git-scm.com/doc)
* [GitHub Cheat Sheet for Git](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf)
* [SourceTree: Free Git GUI Client](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com)

## Source Code Comments

A comment is a programmer-readable explanation or annotation in the source code of a computer program. Anything within comments will be ignored by a compiler and are just there to help us programmers understand the code better.

You'll use comments for documentation and explanation of your code. Anytime you see comments, just know it's there for clarity.

### Line Comment

Also known as single-line comment, line comment syntax is prepended with `#`

```bash
# Example line comment
```
